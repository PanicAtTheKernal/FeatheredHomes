It has blue and yellow feathers that make it easy to recognize. These birds are skilled at finding insects and spiders to eat, but they also enjoy seeds and other plant-based foods when insects are scarce. Eurasian blue tits are known for their acrobatic abilities, such as hanging upside down from branches while looking for food. They typically live in deciduous or mixed woodlands with oak trees, where they nest in tree holes or nest boxes. Their main competitor for both nests and food is the larger great tit.",CYANISTES CAERULEUS,PARIDAE,9a08dd15-e584-4635-a36d-12b239852341,8c030589-893c-4628-96df-d34642555d23,2024-02-29 19:36:44.404,0.1,"{""preen"":true,""canFly"":true,""canSwim"":false,""coparents"":true,""doesSunbathing"":false,""takesDustBaths"":false,""singleMaleParent"":false,""singleFemaleParent"":false}",false,"{""male"":""https://sjiikegnbgahukdwklux.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/BirdAssets/Chickadees/eurasian-blue-tit-male.png"",""female"":""https://sjiikegnbgahukdwklux.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/BirdAssets/Chickadees/eurasian-blue-tit-female.png""}","{""male"":{""#00b7cf"":""#DAA520"",""#03b6ec"":""#DAA520"",""#22b14c"":""#DAA520"",""#2f3699"":""#0000FF"",""#4d6df3"":""#DAA520"",""#4f2445"":""#0000FF"",""#546d8e"":""#B0C4DE"",""#6f3198"":""#DAA520"",""#709ad1"":""#DAA520"",""#85623d"":""#0000FF"",""#990030"":""#000000"",""#99d9ea"":""#DAA520"",""#9c5a3c"":""#3E2817"",""#9c5a3d"":""#9ACD32"",""#a8e61d"":""#FFFFFF"",""#b5a5d5"":""#0000FF"",""#d3f9bc"":""#0000FF"",""#e5aa7a"":""#FFFFFF"",""#e800c5"":""#9ACD32"",""#ed1c24"":""#000000"",""#f5e49c"":""#FFFFFF"",""#ff7e00"":""#0000FF"",""#ffa3b1"":""#FFFFFF"",""#ffc20e"":""#FFFFFF"",""#fff200"":""#00008B"",""#fff9bd"":""#FFFFFF""},""female"":{""#00b7cf"":""#FFD700"",""#03b6ec"":""#0000FF"",""#22b14c"":""#FFD700"",""#2f3699"":""#0000FF"",""#4d6df3"":""#FFD700"",""#4f2445"":""#0000FF"",""#546d8e"":""#5D7B8D"",""#6f3198"":""#FFD700"",""#709ad1"":""#FFD700"",""#85623d"":""#0000FF"",""#990030"":""#000000"",""#99d9ea"":""#FFD700"",""#9c5a3c"":""#3E2723"",""#9c5a3d"":""#9ACD32"",""#a8e61d"":""#FFFFFF"",""#b5a5d5"":""#0000FF"",""#d3f9bc"":""#0000FF"",""#e5aa7a"":""#FFFFFF"",""#e800c5"":""#9ACD32"",""#ed1c24"":""#000000"",""#f5e49c"":""#FFFFFF"",""#ff7e00"":""#007FFF"",""#ffa3b1"":""#FFFFFF"",""#ffc20e"":""#FFFFFF"",""#fff200"":""#00008B"",""#fff9bd"":""#FFFFFF""}}",b5602ca3-ec92-4b8e-b2b3-7ce3443a055c,adf45e29-955d-4def-bc40-eab3bbbce297,false

They are not very different in appearance between males and females. These birds are typically loyal to their partners and raise two chicks at a time.

a95729e9-e85d-4b97-9457-03387167549a,BLACK-HEADED GULL,"The black-headed gull is a small bird that showcases fascinating behaviors and adaptations, such as removing eggshells from the nest and coordinating begging among siblings. They are versatile in their habitats and can be found in various environments. The bird's new scientific name, Chroicocephalus ridibundus, means ""colorful head"" in Ancient Greek and ""abundant"" in Latin. These gulls were previously categorized under the Larus genus but were reclassified based on genetic studies. They breed in the Palearctic region and parts of Canada, with most of them migrating to warmer areas during winter. Some black-headed gulls remain in western Europe throughout the year, while a smaller population can be seen in northeastern North America.",CHROICOCEPHALUS RIDIBUNDUS,LARIDAE,123f9a71-d6e9-40ea-985e-275f5311e621,5bd828f0-805a-4fd0-90a5-039294930d7f,2024-04-04 21:26:42.49,0.1,"{""preen"":true,""canFly"":true,""canSwim"":true,""coparents"":true,""doesSunbathing"":false,""takesDustBaths"":false,""singleMaleParent"":false,""singleFemaleParent"":false}",false,"{""male"":""https://sjiikegnbgahukdwklux.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/BirdAssets/Seagulls/black-headed-gull-male.png"",""female"":""https://sjiikegnbgahukdwklux.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/BirdAssets/Seagulls/black-headed-gull-female.png""}","{""male"":{""#00b7cf"":""#FFFFFF"",""#03b6ec"":""#B0C4DE"",""#22b14c"":""#FFFFFF"",""#2f3699"":""#FFFFFF"",""#4d6df3"":""#B0C4DE"",""#4f2445"":""#000000"",""#546d8e"":""#FF6347"",""#6f3198"":""#B0C4DE"",""#709ad1"":""#FFFFFF"",""#85623d"":""#B0C4DE"",""#990030"":""#FF6347"",""#99d9ea"":""#B0C4DE"",""#9c5a3c"":""#FFFFFF"",""#9c5a3d"":""#B0C4DE"",""#a8e61d"":""#FFFFFF"",""#b5a5d5"":""#FFFFFF"",""#d3f9bc"":""#5C4033"",""#e5aa7a"":""#FFFFFF"",""#e800c5"":""#B0C4DE"",""#ed1c24"":""#FF6347"",""#f5e49c"":""#5C4033"",""#ff7e00"":""#5C4033"",""#ffa3b1"":""#5C4033"",""#ffc20e"":""#5C4033"",""#fff200"":""#5C4033"",""#fff9bd"":""#FFFFFF""},""female"":{""#00b7cf"":""#FFFFFF"",""#03b6ec"":""#BEBEBE"",""#22b14c"":""#FFFFFF"",""#2f3699"":""#BEBEBE"",""#4d6df3"":""#BEBEBE"",""#4f2445"":""#000000"",""#546d8e"":""#FF4500"",""#6f3198"":""#FFFFFF"",""#709ad1"":""#FFFFFF"",""#85623d"":""#BEBEBE"",""#990030"":""#FF4500"",""#99d9ea"":""#FFFFFF"",""#9c5a3c"":""#000000"",""#9c5a3d"":""#BEBEBE"",""#a8e61d"":""#FFFFFF"",""#b5a5d5"":""#FFFFFF"",""#d3f9bc"":""#BEBEBE"",""#e5aa7a"":""#603813"",""#e800c5"":""#BEBEBE"",""#ed1c24"":""#FF4500"",""#f5e49c"":""#FFFFFF"",""#ff7e00"":""#603813"",""#ffa3b1"":""#603813"",""#ffc20e"":""#603813"",""#fff200"":""#603813"",""#fff9bd"":""#FFFFFF""}}",f4880769-0c62-4ad1-8d0b-448ea56e5c6f,23c3ab33-08c1-44ab-ba3c-567b5613cc42,false
