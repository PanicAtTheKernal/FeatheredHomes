". If the description does not define the colour you can use the colour of the closest body part instead within reason. The legs are a different colour from the feathers, if not defined just use the common leg colour of the bird type. Don't use max or min values like [255,255,255] or [0,0,0] etc. Also note that synonyms may be used in the description. Prefer males. No null values. Just the json.

The forehead and a bar on the wing are white. The nape, wings and tail are blue and the back is yellowish green. The underparts are mostly sulphur-yellow with a dark line down the abdomenâ€”the yellowness is indicative of the number of yellowy-green caterpillars eaten, due to high levels of carotene pigments in the diet.[11] The bill is black, the legs bluish grey, and the irides dark brown. The sexes are similar and often indistinguishable to human eyes, but under ultraviolet light, males have a brighter blue crown.[12] Young blue tits are noticeably more yellow. " },
